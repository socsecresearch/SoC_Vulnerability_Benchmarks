# Vulnerable SoC Benchmarks

This repository hosts several SoC Benchmarks that have "system" vulnerability in them exploitable through application software. It is inspired by similar benchmarks in hardware security: [Trust-Hub](https://trust-hub.org/#/benchmarks/chip-level-trojan) and [ISCAS](https://filebox.ece.vt.edu/~mhsiao/iscas89.html) for hardware trojans and logic locking respectively. The objective of this repository is to promote collaboration and cooperation in SoC security verification research community through the use of standardized benchmarks that any verfication methodology can be readily applied upon. The benchmark SoCs are based on open source RISC-V SoCs, namely [NEORV32](https://github.com/stnolting/neorv32) and [Ibex](https://github.com/lowRISC/ibex-demo-system/tree/main). The datasheet available at the respecitve repositories is also applicable to these benchmarks as the individual IP compositions/designs and system wide memory map have not been tinkered with.  
Each benchmark comes with its own C software execution environment which includes linker scripts, startup codes to handle exceptions and makefiles to compile appropriate executables. Therefore, you can just write your own C code, compile using the makefile provided, prototype the system on an FPGA and run said executable on the prototyped design. These benchmarks demonstrate some weakness/vulnerability in either the software or hardware layers that comporomise confidentiality, integrity and/or availability requirements of the security assets. These benchmarks demonstrate
