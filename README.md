# Vulnerable SoC Benchmarks

This repository hosts several SoC Benchmarks that have "system" vulnerability in them exploitable through application software (aka software exploitable vulnerabilities). It is inspired by similar benchmarks in hardware security: [Trust-Hub](https://trust-hub.org/#/benchmarks/chip-level-trojan) and [ISCAS](https://filebox.ece.vt.edu/~mhsiao/iscas89.html) for hardware trojans and logic locking respectively. The objective of this repository is to promote collaboration and cooperation in SoC security verification research community through the use of standardized benchmarks that any verfication methodology can be readily applied upon. These "vulnerable" systems are meant to be representative of the case that designer/integrator mistakes provide gateway to attackers through vulnerabilities. The benchmark SoCs are based on open source RISC-V SoCs, namely [NEORV32](https://github.com/stnolting/neorv32) and [Ibex](https://github.com/lowRISC/ibex-demo-system/tree/main). The datasheet available at the respecitve repositories is also applicable to these benchmarks as the individual IP compositions/designs and system wide memory map have not been tinkered with.  

Each benchmark comes with its own C software execution environment which includes linker scripts, startup codes to handle exceptions and makefiles to compile appropriate executables. Each benchmark also contains a pre-built bitstream file that can be readily downloaded. Therefore, you can just write your own C code (or maybe use the ones generated by your verification methodology), compile using the makefile provided, prototype the system on an FPGA and run said executable on the prototyped design. These benchmarks demonstrate some weakness/vulnerability in either the software or hardware layer that comporomise confidentiality, integrity and/or availability requirements of the security assets. Despite these weaknesses/vulnerabilities, they are "fully" functional insofar as you will be able to execute almost all valid C/assembly programs on these SoCs (provided that they do not require RISC-V extensions beyond what is present and do not require dynamic memory allocation on the heap). "Functional" does not necessarily imply secure!

# Getting Started
The easiest way to get started with these benchmarks is to upload the pre-built bitstream to the corresponding Xilinx FPGA. You can find them in the **fpga** directory of corresponding benchmark folders. You can also find the required constraints file to synthesize these designs in these directories. Each directory also contains a demo blink LED program + exectuable which you can upload using OpenOCD + GNU GDB.  The [debugging](https://github.com/socsecresearch/SoC_Vulnerability_Benchmarks/edit/main/README.md#debugging) section provides the instructions for doing so. 
# Debugging
Each benchmark supports single-step debug of the executable run on it. To upload the exectuable
# Testing the vulnerabilities
We would recommend using the prebuilt bitstreams since the purpose of these benchmarks is to promote gray/black box system verification methodologies. This means that you would treat the system as a kind of acquired 3PIP for which you do not have access to full implementation/microarchitectural knowledge. This is in keeping with the verification challenge faced by the industry and academia today (you can read more on these challenges through these excellent resources: [1](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7987680?casa_token=G2w5FVmeee4AAAAA:CsH_ujwRud2UJ_zzqBUVMlrquUjtXIl6Lfe2C-D1i1xruy-qfuuQrMQktwG0CnlVf2aMzum7G4Q), [2](https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity19/presentation/dessouky), [3](https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/394). The software "exploit" binary that will make the security requirement violation apparent is present in **exploit** directory of corresponding benchmarks. 

However, we also provide RTL of the system hardware present in each directory that you could utilize for more white box approaches (such as formal & UVM).
# How to Setup Vivado Projects for Different Boards
We realize that not you may not possess the boards that we have provided FPGA bitstreams for at your disposal. To help you with setting up the project for synthesis, we are providing you video tutorials that you can follow along to set up your own projects. The only change will be in the constraints file that you use for your own board. We do not provide constraint files for other boards but you can find [master constraints file](https://github.com/Digilent/digilent-xdc/blob/master/Basys-3-Master.xdc) on the internet. You would just have be careful in using only the resources available on your specific board.
